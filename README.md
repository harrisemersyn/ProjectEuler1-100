Project Euler Problems 1 through 100
-----------------------------------------

These are my implementations of the first 100 problems of Project Euler. Everything is written in Java.

My most efficient solution for each problem is labeled as "Problem(number)", while my other attempts are labeled with a letter following the problem number. In each folder, there is a markdown file for notes on the problems, explaining each solution attempt and their differences in runtime.
